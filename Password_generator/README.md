I will make an excellent little password generator here. I plan to use this to create all my passwords for all future and current accounts.

I created the file; I've been busy with schoolwork, but I think I'm going to try to figure out the Tkinter library to have an actual GUI.

I was also completely overlooking the .get() function needed to pull the value from the inputs
