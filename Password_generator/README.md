I will make an excellent little password generator here. I plan to use this to create passwords for all future and current accounts.

Just set up my code editor to work with Github!

I created the file; I've been busy with schoolwork, but I will try to figure out how to use the Tkinter library to have an actual GUI.

I'm adding many inputs to the file. I just spent a little bit of time learning how Tkinter actually works. With some trial and error, I got it to function how I wanted. 
I also completely overlooked the .get() function needed to pull the value from the inputs.

At first, I had an if-else statement to check if at least one character type was selected, but I found that Tkinter has a progress bar, and I want to add that to my file just because. So, I just created an if statement to see if no characters were selected, and if none were, it just returns.
Currently, I'm just printing to the console because I haven't figured out how to get a message to pop up or for a label to change.
